      <description>Back on April 6th, 2019 I made a journey with Road Runner for him to test ride some bikes. I road my 2019 Ultra Limited while he was on his Victory. I ended up going on a test ride at an Indian dealer and four days later ended up picking up a 2019 Indian Chieftain Dark Horse.
  2019 Indian Chieftain Purchase  So why did I walk away with an Indian when I already own a 2019 Ultra Limited?</description>
