      <description>Intro Welcome to Spaz on Wheels. This is the beginning of my blogging regarding my motorcyle adventures. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% certain where this will go, but figure I&amp;rsquo;ll start putting my thoughts here and post some of my travels as well to share with others.
Background I started riding motorcycles pretty late actually versus some. I got my first bike in 2008 when I was 29 years old. The bike I chose to start with was a 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 1500cc.</description>
