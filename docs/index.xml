      <description>Back on April 6th, 2019 I made a journey with Road Runner for him to test ride some bikes. I road my 2019 Ultra Limited while he was on his Victory. I ended up going on a test ride at an Indian dealer and four days later ended up picking up a 2019 Indian Chieftain Dark Horse.
  2019 Indian Chieftain Purchase  So why did I walk away with an Indian when I already own a 2019 Ultra Limited?</description>

      <description>Intro Welcome to Spaz on Wheels. This is the beginning of my blogging regarding my motorcyle adventures. I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% certain where this will go, but figure I&amp;rsquo;ll start putting my thoughts here and post some of my travels as well to share with others.
Background I started riding motorcycles pretty late actually versus some. I got my first bike in 2008 when I was 29 years old. The bike I chose to start with was a 2007 Kawasaki Vulcan 1500cc.</description>
