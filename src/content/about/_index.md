Welcome to Spaz on Wheels. This is my personal blog about my adventures on wheels. Currently my focus is on motorcycles but I love all things with wheels. I formally resided north of Milwaukee Wisconsin the home of Harley. I have since moved to Kansas. I currently am riding both a Harley and Triump Tiger 1200. My posts tell that story.
