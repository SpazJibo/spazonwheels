Well it has been a very long time since I posted anything on my blog. I'm going to start getting more active again. Recently I decided to purchase a new motorcycle. I have to thank my wife for swapping bikes and letting me trade her 2017 Street Glide Special. This journey started with me test riding a friends Triumph Tiger. You can see my ride here.

Well a couple weeks later and I dropped the wife's Harley for the Tiger (Maybe even literally...). I am still getting used to my Tiger at this point but I have to say I love it.

I've even drove this off road a couple times learning how the bike handles.

I'm hoping to continue adding more and more content here.
